# About

This is my CV repository. Here you can find my CV in different formats or you can see it online [here](https://klpod221.github.io/cv/).

You can also clone this repository and use it as a template for your own CV.

# Usage

To use this repository as a template for your own CV, you can clone it and start editing the files. You can also fork it and make your changes there.

To export the CV to PDF or PNG, you can use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) like me or you can use any other tool you like.

However, if you want to use Puppeteer, you can use the following command to generate the files:

```bash
npm install (or yarn install)
node export.js
```

This will generate a PDF and a PNG file in the `output` folder.
